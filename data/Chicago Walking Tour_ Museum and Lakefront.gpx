If you're visiting with young children, look for the Crown Family PlayLab. This just-for-kids spot is included in the general admission price. It's a place where pint-sized scientists can dig up dinosaur bones, harvest corn, play in a Pueblo, learn about sound and pretend they are woodland creatures.

This statue was first dedicated in 1904 in Humboldt Park, a neighborhood on the Northwest Side of Chicago. It was moved to this spot and rededicated in 1978.

Another Polish war hero, Casimir Pulaski, is revered by Chicago public school students. They get the first Monday in March off school in honor of the Revolutionary War hero.]]></desc>

This monument by Joseph Strachovsky shows Havlicek in a revolutionary pose, dressed in a full military uniform and a draped cape with his outstretched arm motioning the viewer to join him. It was installed in Douglas Park in 1910 and moved to Solidarity Drive in 1981.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[The Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum was the first planetarium built in the Western Hemisphere and is the oldest in existence today. It was founded and built in 1930 by the philanthropist Max Adler.

There's plenty of cutting-edge technology to see, but don't discount an old favorite: the Atwood Sphere. Chicago's oldest planetarium, it was built in 1913 and has 692 holes drilled through its metal surface to show the positions of the brightest stars in the night sky. The decidedly low-tech sphere is 15 feet in diameter. It accommodates only a few visitors at a time.

    <desc><![CDATA[Northerly Island is a 91-acre man-made peninsula. The nature center that occupies the space now had a  controversial beginning.

The area was envisioned as a lakefront park in the original 1909 Plan for Chicago created by Daniel Burnham, but it was converted into a private airport in the 1940s. It remained an airport until one night in 2003 when former Mayor Richard M. Daley, long a proponent of returning Northerly Island to its roots as a public park, sent in bulldozers overnight to carve giant Xs in the runway, stranding some private aircraft. 

Today it is home to walking paths, a popular fishing spot and a concert venue as well as the 12th Street Beach swimming area.]]></desc>

But it is worth a look in that direction to see the modern addition plopped on top of the century-old structure. The controversial design was dubbed the "toilet bowl" by a Chicago columnist; others suggested it looked as though a space ship had landed on top of Soldier Field.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA['Agora']]></name>
    <desc><![CDATA[This public art installation by Magdalena Abakanowicz stands at the southwest corner of Michigan Avenue and Roosevelt Road, on the walk between the Museum Campus and the L platform. It consists of 106 headless figures, posed as if walking in multiple directions or standing still, frozen in time. 

The city's public art guide says: "Each figure commands a dramatic presence on the landscape. In ancient Greece, the agora was the central meeting place in a village or city. Similarly, Magdalena Abakanowicz's figures invite viewers to gather and become part of the artwork. Agora extends the traditions of monumental figurative sculpture, offering a contemporary expression and a reflection of our time.

"Abakanowicz donated the artwork's design and worked with a group of Polish artists who volunteered to construct the pieces in Poznan, Poland. 'Agora' was made possible through the cooperation of the Polish Ministry
of Culture and a Polish private foundation."]]></desc>
